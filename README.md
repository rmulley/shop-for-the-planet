#Shopping for a Better Planet

A community built list of ways to shop for products that promote sustainable agriculture.

##Why Build This Guide?

After reading an article on why <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/29/sustainable-coffee_n_5175192.html" target="_blank">The Coffee Industry Is Worse Than Ever For The Environment</a> it got me thinking;  If I had known to look for the <a href="http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/" target="_blank">Rainforest Alliance</a> logo on the coffee I purchased all these years I would have.  The problem is that I didn't know that the Rainforest Alliance, or this specific agricultural problem, existed.  That's when I came up with the idea for this GitHub repo.

My hope is that this repo will become a definitive list on best shopping practices for a better planet.  Driven by the community at large, we can leverage OSS (Open Source Shopping) to promote sustainable agriculture by voting with our dollars.
